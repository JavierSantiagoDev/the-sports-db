When the list of teams is showed, you can click in one team to deploy the details view of the team with general information and the next five matches of the team.
[PROBLEMS WITH THE API] = The Next 5 events of the team api is only for patreons, so i used the Last 5 Events by Team Id (Limited to home team for free tier). And this API only shows the matches when the choosed team was the local.
